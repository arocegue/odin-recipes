## About the Project

This project demonstrates foundational HTML skills:
- Creating a main index page that links to individual recipe pages.
- Structuring content using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
- Navigating between pages with relative paths.

By completing this project, I‚Äôve reinforced my understanding of:
- Basic HTML boilerplate.
- Internal linking and directory organization.
- Proper usage of semantic tags for content organization.

## Built With
