## About the Project

This project demonstrates foundational HTML skills:
- Creating a main index page that links to individual recipe pages.
- Structuring content using headings, paragraphs, lists, and images.
- Navigating between pages with relative paths.

By completing this project, I’ve reinforced my understanding of:
- Basic HTML boilerplate.
- Internal linking and directory organization.
- Proper usage of semantic tags for content organization.

## Built With

- **HTML5** – For the core structure of the pages.

*(No CSS or JavaScript is used in this initial version. Styling and interactivity may be added later.)*
